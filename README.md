# Weather App Backend (Django)

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a robust and efficient Django backend for a weather application. The backend acts as an intermediary between the frontend (React) and third-party weather APIs, offering features such as data caching and optional user authentication for personalized experiences.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Developed using Django REST Framework to handle weather data requests from the frontend.
- **Efficient Caching**: Caches responses from third-party APIs to minimize redundant calls and improve response times.
- **Weather Data Normalization**: Transforms incoming data from external APIs into a standardized format.
- **User Authentication (Optional)**: Allows for user management and personalized experiences.

## Goals

- Create a functional and scalable **RESTful API** to handle weather data requests from the frontend.
- Implement **caching mechanisms** to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary third-party API calls.
- Build a service layer that efficiently interacts with external weather APIs.
- Ensure **data consistency** and **integrity** by normalizing API responses.
- (Optional) Implement **user authentication** to enable personalized user features.

## Scope

### API Endpoints

- **POST /weather/**: Accepts location data (city name or coordinates) and returns current weather data.
- **GET /weather/{city}/**: Returns cached weather data for a specified city.
- **GET /weather/coordinates/**: Fetches weather data for provided geographical coordinates.
- **Forecast Endpoints**: Retrieves 3-day or 7-day weather forecasts.

### Caching

- **Caching Layer**: Uses Django's caching framework with a 5-minute expiration time to optimize repeated requests.
- **Cache Check**: Ensures that external API calls are only made if the cache is expired or unavailable.

### Weather API Integration

- Integrates with a reliable third-party weather API - OpenWeatherMap and Weatherbit.
- Normalizes weather data into a consistent format to serve to the frontend.

### User Authentication

- Implements **user authentication** using Django’s built-in authentication system or token-based authentication (via Django REST Framework).
- Supports user sessions for personalized weather features (e.g., saved locations, preferences).

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: Django
- **API Development**: Django REST Framework
- **Caching**: Django’s caching framework (with Memcached or Redis as the backend)
- **External APIs**: OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, or similar
- **Optional**: **Celery** for background tasks such as cache refreshing.

## Deliverables

- A well-documented **Django project** with RESTful API endpoints to fetch and cache weather data.
- A **service layer** that abstracts and handles interactions with external weather APIs.
- Comprehensive **API documentation** (via tools such as Postman).
- **User Authentication** implementation for secure access and personalized features.

## Success Criteria

- Fully functional **API endpoints** that reliably return accurate weather data.
- **Efficient caching** that reduces external API calls and improves overall system performance.
- **Clean, well-documented, and maintainable** code.
- (Optional) **Secure user authentication** and enhanced user experience features.
